The Impossible Problem
=====

The Impossible Problem is a very beautiful problem about integer numbers. Its
original form was given by Freudenthal [1] before being popularized by Martin
Gardner [2]. The two problems are not exactly the same. Gardner's version is as
follows:

<quote>
Two numbers (not necessarily different) are chosen from the range of positive
integers greater than 1 and not greater than 20. Only the sum of the two numbers
is given to mathematician S. Only the product of the two is given to
mathematician P.

On the telephone S says to P, "I see no way you can determine my sum." An hour
later P calls him back to say, "I know your sum." Later S calls P again to
report, "Now I know your product."

What are the two numbers?

This article explain how this problem can be solved with computer assistence and
also without it. (The code is available.) It also gives some suprising results
about what happens when the bound (20) is changed.
